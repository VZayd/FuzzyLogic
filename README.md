Fuzzy Logic

This program calculates the similarity between two strings using the fuzz.ratio() method from the fuzzywuzzy library, which returns a value between 0 and 100 indicating the percentage of similarity between the two strings. In this example, the output would be something like 'apple' and 'banana' are not similar.

You can also use fuzz.token_set_ratio() or fuzz.token_sort_ratio() to compare similarity of the strings based on token sets and token sorts respectively.
